# 1-IntroC-_AST-23-24

## Introduction:

This practical exercise is made to be introduced into C++ program lenguage. So in this repository are eleven exercises wich are perfect to learn C++ if you are learning it for the first time. You can find the statements in Spanish in this [PDF](https://github.com/clases-julio/1-introc-ast-23-24-alacoste2017/blob/main/practica.pdf). I will explain the statements in english below.

## Ejercicio1.cpp

Write a program which ask the user for 2 integers and calculate their addition, product, difference
and division.

## Ejercicio2.cpp

Write a program which prints integers from 1 to 4 separated by spaces. Do it following the next steps:

1. Using a simple instruction with the use of only 1 "<<" operator.
2. Using a simple instruction with the use of 4 "<<" operators.
3. using four instructions.

## Ejercicio3.cpp

Write a program which ask the user to write 2 integers. The program has to write the highest one followed by the expresion "es más grande". If both numbers are equal, the program has to print the message "estos números son iguales".

## Ejercicio4.cpp

Write a program which ask the user 3 integers. The program has to print the addition, the mean, the product, the highest and the lowest number. The dialog of the program has to belike this:

Introduzca 3 numeros enteros: 13 27 14 // *(asking 3 integers)*

La suma es 54 // *(the addition)*

El promedio es 18 // *(the mean)*

El producto es 4914 // *(the product)*

El menor es 13  // *(the lowest)*

El mayor es 27 // *(the highest)*

## Ejercicio5.cpp

Write a program that reads the radius of a circle as an integer and prints its diameter, circumference, and area. Use the constant value 3.14159 for π. Perform all calculations in output statements.

## Ejercicio6.cpp

Write an application that displays a chessboard pattern as shown in section 'ejercicio 6' in [here](https://github.com/clases-julio/1-introc-ast-23-24-alacoste2017/blob/main/practica.pdf). First, do it using eight output statements (cout), and then attempt to do it using the fewest number of statements possible.

## Ejercicio7.cpp

Write a program that takes as input a five-digit integer, separates that number into its individual digits, and prints them, each separated from the others by three spaces. For example, if the user enters the number 31250, the program should print: 3 1 2 5 0.

## Ejercicio8.cpp

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is written as n! (n factorial) and is defined as follows: n! = n(n–1)(n–2)...1 (for values of n greater than or equal to 1) and n! = 1 (for n = 0 or n = 1).

For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1, which is 120. Use while loops in each of the following cases:

1. Write an application that reads a non-negative integer, calculates, and prints its factorial.
2. Write a program that estimates the value of the mathematical constant e using the formula: e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + .... Ask the user for the desired precision of e (i.e., the number of terms in the sum).
3. Write an application that calculates the value of e^x using the formula: e^x = 1 + x/1! + x^2/2! + x^3/3! + ... Ask the user for the desired precision of e (i.e., the number of terms in the sum).

## Ejercicio9.cpp

Calculate the value of π from the infinite series: π = 4 − 4/3 + 4/5 − 4/7 + 4/9 − 4/11 + .... Print a table that shows the approximate value of π after each of the first 1000 terms of this series.

## Ejercicio10.cpp

Write a program that prints a diamond shape as it is showed in the section 'Ejercicio 10' in [here](https://github.com/clases-julio/1-introc-ast-23-24-alacoste2017/blob/main/practica.pdf) . You can use output statements that print a single asterisk (*) or a single space. Maximize the use of repetition (with nested for statements) and minimize the number of output statements.

## (BONUS) Ejercicio10pro.cpp

Improve the program (ejercicio10.cpp) to read an odd number in the range of 1 to 19, corresponding to the number of rows that make up the diamond, and then display a diamond of the appropriate size.

## Peculiarities

As this is our first contact with C++, Let's overlook that when asking the user for integers, they will always input integers and not characters or character strings.
